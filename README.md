Institute for Advanced Analytics Text Analytics Fall 2023 Project. Collaborated with Kush Patel, Cinoon Bak, Harper Wang, and Ngoni Emeh- Festus

We will analyze ingredients from 10 different cuisines available on the website Food.com. Our focus is to identify and compare trends between cuisines by analyzing ingredients, reviews, and recipe instructions from Food.com. We will utilize recipes from each of the 10 cuisines to create visualizations of word and phrase frequencies. Then, we will apply sentiment analysis to the content, and analyze the results to provide a summary of global ingredients and their associated meanings.
